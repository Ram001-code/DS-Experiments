## Data Science Experiment 1

This Jupyter Notebook explores a sample dataset and performs some basic data manipulation and analysis.

**Requirements:**

* This notebook requires Python 3 and the following libraries:
  * pandas
  * numpy
  * scipy
  * matplotlib.pyplot
  * seaborn
  * scipy.stats

**Steps:**

1. **Mount Google Drive (Optional):**
   - If you are using Google Colab, you can uncomment the following line to mount your Google Drive and access your datasets.
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```

2. **Import Libraries:**
   - Import the necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.

3. **Import Dataset:**
   - Read the CSV file containing the student data. The example code assumes the file is named "student_info.csv" and located in the same directory as the notebook.

4. **Data Exploration:**
   - Explore the data using descriptive statistics and visualizations (optional).

**Note:**

- This is a basic example, and the specific steps involved will depend on your specific dataset and analysis goals.
- You can modify and extend this notebook to perform additional data analysis tasks.

**Further Exploration:**

- You can explore more advanced data manipulation techniques with pandas.
- You can create more complex visualizations with libraries like seaborn.
- You can perform more in-depth statistical analysis with libraries like scipy.stats.


I hope this helps!
